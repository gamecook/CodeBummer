Hello,

Welcome to Code Bummer's source code. I will be adding instructions here
on how to use this file but for now just copy build.template.properties to 
build.properties, point FLEX_HOME to where you keep your Flex 4.0 SDK lives on 
your computer, run the build file then sit back and enjoy the show.

You will need to set up paths to the Android SDK and add AIR 2.5 for Android
to your Flex SDK if you want to deploy to the phone. The ANT build will
automatically generate a certificate.
